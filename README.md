NN_ERC
**A simple neural network project Since this was my first project in python, 
I struggled quite a bit with the syntax and numpy library. A lot of the code was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU. 
I understand each step in great detail but implementation here was my bane. Even if this is rejected, I learned quite a bit about this language so 
I am grateful for this opportunity and would participate in such competitions again.**
